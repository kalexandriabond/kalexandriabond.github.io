Welcome! I'm Alexandria, a computational cognitive neuroscientist in the Psychiatry department at Yale. I work with [Al Powers](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/powers/). I'm interested in developing precision psychiatry methods to improve the quality of life for neurodiverse people.


Over the 9 years I've been lucky enough to study the brain, I've used a mix of empirical methods (neuroimaging, reach kinematics, eye-tracking), computational modeling (neural networks, drift diffusion modeling, Bayesian agents) and applied machine learning (neural decoding) to study the mechanisms of naturalistic learning and decision-making in biological agents. 

In my free time, you'll likely catch me biking or running. I'm also passionate about leading DEI advocacy efforts with concrete impact, often through education & policy reform at the local level. 

I welcome collaboration and curiosity about my work. If you're interested in teaming up, [let's talk](https://outlook.office.com/bookwithme/user/b64057b10c5a41eea08a3aba57110d89@yale.edu?anonymous&ep=plink)!
