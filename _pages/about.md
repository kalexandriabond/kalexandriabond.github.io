Hello! I'm Alexandria. I recently graduated with my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from the [Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/) and the Psychology Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I was advised by [Tim Verstynen](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/cognitiveaxon/members.html).

<!-- I aim to better understand how humans learn to see and understand the world, and how networks within our brains support these feats of perception and cognition. In particular, I am interested in cortical networks underlying high-level vision (face and object recognition and reading), and tend to think about these networks through the lens of cognitive computational neuroscience and deep learning, with a focus on generic architectures, learning algorithms, and naturalistic inputs. I also do neuroimaging and psychophysical experiments to gain new empirical insights, and am interested in translating novel insights into better treatments for developmental and acquired neurological and neuropsychological disorders.  -->

<!-- My work has involved the development of computational models of [familiar and unfamiliar face recognition](/publication/cognition2020) and [cortical organization for visual domains](/publication/pnas2022). The latter work introduced a class of computational models of visual cortical topography, referred to as Interactive Topographic Networks. The code to simulate these models and further develop them is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/viscog-cmu/ITN.git). A good introduction to this modeling work is a talk from Vision Sciences Society 2021 Conference, below.  -->
