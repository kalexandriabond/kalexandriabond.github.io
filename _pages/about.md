Hello! I'm Alexandria. I recently graduated with my PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from the [Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/) and the Psychology Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I was advised by [Tim Verstynen](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/cognitiveaxon/members.html).
