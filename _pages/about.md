Welcome! I'm Alexandria, a computational cognitive neuroscientist at the [Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/) and the Psychology Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm advised by [Tim Verstynen](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/cognitiveaxon/members.html).

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in how learning processes evolve over time in naturalistic environments, where the landscape of reinforcement is ever-shifting. I approach this from a cognitive computational neuroscience perspective -- how does the brain implement the underlying learning algorithms that drive adaptive behavior? To get at this, I combine computational modeling, neuroimaging, physiological measures, and behavioral methods.
