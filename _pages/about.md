Welcome! I'm Alexandria, a computational cognitive neuroscientist at the [Center for 
the Neural Basis of Cognition](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/) and the Psychology 
Department at Carnegie Mellon University. I work with [Tim 
Verstynen](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/cognitiveaxon/members.html).

Did you know that a species of mold is capable of solving complex problems? No?!

I, too, am constantly amazed by the adaptive capabilities of living organisms. As a neurotech enthusiast, I'm particularly interested in how natural organisms can inspire the development of more effective and efficient AI algorithms.

Over the 9 years I've been lucky enough to study the brain, I've used a mix of empirical methods (neuroimaging, reach kinematics, eye-tracking), computational modeling (neural networks, drift diffusion modeling, Bayesian agents) and applied machine learning (neural decoding) to study the mechanisms of naturalistic learning and decision-making in biological agents. 

In my free time, you'll likely catch me biking or running. I'm also passionate about leading DEI advocacy efforts with concrete impact, often through education & policy reform at the local level. 

I'm currently seeking opportunities in neurotech and welcome collaboration or inquiries about my work. So if you're interested in teaming up, let's talk!



See below for an overview of my work:
