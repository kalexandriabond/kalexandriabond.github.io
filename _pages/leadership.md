Research thrives when scholars have the mentorship, resources, and institutional support to advance their work. My leadership focuses on improving researcher development, well-being, and academic policies through data-driven decision-making and collaboration.

As **Vice President of Academic Affairs** for Carnegie Mellonâ€™s Graduate Student Assembly, I led initiatives to enhance graduate mentorship and expand healthcare access. Partnering with Institutional Research, I helped design a mentorship framework tailored to evolving student needs and collaborated with university leadership to secure f**ree health insurance for all graduate students**, including expanded mental health coverage.

I have also served as an invited advisor on multiple university committees, including the Vice Provost of Research Search Committee, the University Student Advising Committee, and the University Education Council. Working closely with Associate Deans for Graduate Programs, I provided insight into student experiences and advocated for policy improvements in research and education.

Effective academic leadership builds systems that support both scholarship and well-being. Whether advocating for policy changes, mentoring students, or strengthening research infrastructure, I strive to create an environment where scholars can focus on inquiry and innovation without compromising their well-being.
