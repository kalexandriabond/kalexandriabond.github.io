Research thrives in environments where scholars have the necessary support, mentorship, and institutional structure to advance their work. My leadership efforts have focused on improving researcher development, well-being, and academic policies through data-driven decision-making and institutional collaboration.

As **Vice President of Academic Affairs for Carnegie Mellonâ€™s Graduate Student Assembly**, I led initiatives to enhance graduate mentorship and expand access to healthcare. Working with Institutional Research, I helped design a mentorship framework aligned with the evolving needs of graduate students. I also collaborated with university leadership to implement free health insurance for all graduate students, including expanded mental health coverage.

Beyond this role, I have served as an invited advisor on multiple university committees, including the Vice Provost of Research Search Committee, the University Student Advising Committee, and the University Education Council. In these capacities, I contributed to discussions on research policy, graduate education, and institutional strategy. I also worked directly with Associate Deans for Graduate Programs, providing insight into student experiences and advocating for policy improvements.

Academic leadership is about building systems that support scholarship and professional growth. Whether advocating for policy improvements, mentoring students, or strengthening research infrastructure, my goal is to help create an academic environment where scholars can focus on inquiry, discovery, and innovation.
